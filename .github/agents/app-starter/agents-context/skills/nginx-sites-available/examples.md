# Nginx Sites Available Default Configuration

> **Critical**: This skill creates `nginx-sites-available-default` in the **root directory** of the project.

## File Location
**Output**: `nginx-sites-available-default` (project root)

## Required Configuration

```nginx
##
# You should look at the following URL's in order to grasp a solid understanding
# of Nginx configuration files in order to fully unleash the power of Nginx.
# https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/
# https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/config_pitfalls/
# https://wiki.debian.org/Nginx/DirectoryStructure
#
# In most cases, administrators will remove this file from sites-enabled/ and
# leave it as reference inside of sites-available where it will continue to be
# updated by the nginx packaging team.
#
# This file will automatically load configuration files provided by other
# applications, such as Drupal or Wordpress. These applications will be made
# available underneath a path with that package name, such as /drupal8.
#
# Please see /usr/share/doc/nginx-doc/examples/ for more detailed examples.

# Default server configuration
#
server {
	listen 8080 default_server;
	listen [::]:8080 default_server;

	# SSL configuration
	#
	# listen 443 ssl default_server;
	# listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;
	#
	# Note: You should disable gzip for SSL traffic.
	# See: https://bugs.debian.org/773332
	#
	# Read up on ssl_ciphers to ensure a secure configuration.
	# See: https://bugs.debian.org/765782
	#
	# Self signed certs generated by the ssl-cert package
	# Don't use them in a production server!
	#
	# include snippets/snakeoil.conf;

	root /usr/share/nginx/html;

	# Add index.php to the list if you are using PHP
	index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

	# server_name _;
	server_name  localhost;

	location / {
		# First attempt to serve request as file, then
		# as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
		# try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
		try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
	}
	#error_page  404              /404.html;
    # redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html
    #
    error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
    }

	# pass PHP scripts to FastCGI server
	#
	#location ~ \.php$ {
	#	include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
	#
	#	# With php-fpm (or other unix sockets):
	#	fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
	#	# With php-cgi (or other tcp sockets):
	#	fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
	#}

	# deny access to .htaccess files, if Apache's document root
	# concurs with nginx's one
	#
	#location ~ /\.ht {
	#	deny all;
	#}
}


# Virtual Host configuration for example.com
#
# You can move that to a different file under sites-available/ and symlink that
# to sites-enabled/ to enable it.
#
#server {
#	listen 80;
#	listen [::]:80;
#
#	server_name example.com;
#
#	root /var/www/example.com;
#	index index.html;
#
#	location / {
#		try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
#	}
#}
```

## Key Configuration Points

### SPA Routing (Required)
```nginx
try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
```
- **Critical for Vue Router**: Ensures client-side routes work
- Without this: Direct URL access returns 404, page refresh breaks app

### IPv4 and IPv6 Support
```nginx
listen 8080 default_server;
listen [::]:8080 default_server;
```
- Listens on both IPv4 and IPv6
- Port 8080 for containerized applications
- `default_server`: Catch-all for requests without matching server_name

### Document Root
```nginx
root /usr/share/nginx/html;
```
- Serves static files from `/usr/share/nginx/html` (where Vite build output is copied)

### Error Handling
```nginx
error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
```
- Custom error page for server errors
- Provides better user experience

### SSL Configuration (Template)
SSL configuration is included as commented template for production use.

## Docker Integration
This file is copied to nginx in the Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
RUN cp -a nginx-sites-available-default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

## Sites-Available vs Sites-Enabled
- **sites-available/**: Storage for all nginx configurations
- **sites-enabled/**: Symlinks to active configurations (nginx loads these)
- Enable: `ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`

## Notes
- Port 8080 is standard for containerized applications
- Configuration includes comprehensive comments and examples (SSL, PHP, virtual hosts)
- All configuration values are production-ready defaults
- Commented sections provide templates for common nginx patterns
