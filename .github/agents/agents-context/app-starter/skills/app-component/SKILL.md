# App Component Skill

## Purpose
Generate the `src/App.vue` root component.

## Output
Create the file: `src/App.vue`

## Notes
- Simple root component with router-view
- The `id` attribute should use the `appId` constant from global constants
- Imports theme variables for global styling
- No scoped styles to allow global CSS
- Component should be minimal and serve as a container for the router view
