# Prettier Config Skill

## Purpose
Generate Prettier configuration file for code formatting.

## Output
Create the file: `.prettierrc`

## Notes
- Enforces consistent code style across the project
- Uses single quotes for strings
- Requires semicolons at end of statements
- ES5 trailing commas for better git diffs and version control. If there are newer stable versions, implement it instead.
- Minimal configuration using Prettier's sensible defaults
- Works with ESLint and other code quality tools
